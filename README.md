# CWRU-Coding-Challenge-2019
CWRU Coding Challenge 2019 is a university-wide activity (with idea of Gary Yao) to promote students' passion for competitive programming. <br>
...and it was my pleasure to contribute 4 problems in this challenge.

# Test formatting
There are two testcase folders in each problem: <i>input</i> and <i>output</i>. <br>
Testcases are named with the following format: input<i>xxx</i>.txt and output<i>xxx</i>.txt
